He saw a troubling theme in mathematics instruction: a serious disconnect between the students' basic skills training and the curriculum they were expected to master in the years to come.

As a teacher-trainer and consultant in public and top private schools, and father to a mathematically gifted son, Larry possessed an incredibly comprehensive view of education. In his work with both stellar and struggling math programs, he clearly identified a common theme in mathematics instruction: a ""serious disconnect between students' basic skills training and the curriculum they are expected to master in the years to come.""

The fundamental philosophy is to understand what the bar graders need and speak the ""bar language"" through comprehensive one-on-one instruction.The California Bar Exam does not test on memory retention, but on application. Bar graders look for students to apply the law on a case by case basis. Our course focuses on all three sections of the bar exam: Performance, MBEs and Essays. Every area of study is reviewed one-on-one with our teaching staff. Students also gain access to the Learning Center, which is equipped with personal workspace, Wi-Fi, library and kitchen.We show students how to organize, categorize, and apply laws and facts. By helping students master skills, such as dialoguing about a given scenario and using the law to support the conclusion, we provide you with the toolHistoryEstablished in 2006.The bar exam measures a student's ability to represent clients, not to represent the law. The Open Book Bar Prep course is founded on personal attention. We believe that the key to a student's success is one-on-one tutoring, dialogue, and practice. The Learning Center was created to give students a comfortable place to study. Full-time students obtain 24/7 entry to the Learning Center, which includes personal space, Wi-Fi, access to a library, and use of a kitchen. Open Book Bar Prep began shortly after the founder graduated from law school. The founder saw the bar exam in a different light than most: he enjoyed it!

Working from my childhood bedroom at my parents' home in the San Fernando Valley, we started to lay the groundwork for what would eventually become Tier One Tutors.Beginning with just two tutors, we mostly solicited business from friends and family members who lived in the area. However, we quickly made a name for ourselves because of our relentless pursuit for excellence and our commitment to every student..Shortly thereafter, we turned to the SAT. After a full year of exhaustive research and development, we created our first ""Study Smart"" system for SAT success. We have also branched out into tutoring ACT as well as any and all subjects pre-college.Today, our program has been taught to over 10,000 local students via private tutoring and group classes and we have partnered with nearly 100 schools across the Southland.Meet the Business Owner",Steve D.,Yes,No,4.5 star rating,14 reviews,http://www.tieronetutors.com,,Mon 9:00 am - 6:00 pm<br>Tue 9:00 am - 6:00 pm<br>Wed 9:00 am - 6:00 pm<br>Thu 9:00 am - 6:00 pm<br>Fri 9:00 am - 6:00 pm<br>Sat Closed<br>Sun Closed<br>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Private Tutors, Test Preparation, Private Tutors, Test Preparation",,,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LbXHEyF1cpSzQ0Fl-epW7g/ls.jpg,http://www.yelp.com/biz/tier-one-tutors-los-angeles?osq=Tutoring,,,,,,

We provide meaningful instruction, using input from teachers and parents, to all of our students. We help them catch up, maintain skills, and excel. We offer academic consultations, phone-in assistance, and lessons designed with your student's needs in mind at affordable rates without long-term contracts.HistoryEstablished in 2009.Kristen began working with students in their homes in 2008 after she earned her Multiple Subject Credential from CSULB. Through referrals, she quickly filled her schedule and needed to bring on other credentialed teachers to work with a rapidly-growing number of students. In 2009, she opened an academic studio to host small group workshops. Kristen says, ""Our approach to our curriculum is simple: every student learns best in a different way. Some students need hands-on activities to understand concepts, and others benefit more from repetition and memorization. We take input from the people that know the student best (you and the student's teacher), and merge these ideas with the standards that the nation expects all students to master at that grade level.""

The Learning Path helps students excel in Math, Reading, Writing, and in Life. Our program creates tailored, individualized lesson plans that help students master the fundamentals for learning anything, teaching children to teach themselves, and giving students a joy for learning. Our program creates confident, capable, and independent students. Our students range in age from preschool, starting at 3 years of age and learning how to read, and extend all the way to high school, with students preparing for the SAT and mastering higher level Math. Our diagnostic testing and curricula are mapped to the new Common Core standards. For younger students, we emphasize a mastery of fundamental skills in the basics before shifting focus to the Common Core. We have extensive and proven experience helping children, having been in business since 2009. We have transformed countless students from struggling in school to being at the top of their class.HistoryEstablished in 2009.We have gone through a couple of name and curricula changes over the last few years, all in an effort to find the most effective programs for our children. We expect that we will continue to evolve to ensure that we are always providing the best services to our students - including an early adoption of the Common Core Standards.The Learning Path uses a variety of curricula, as no single approach will fit every student. It is our job to ensure that we are having the maximum effect on a child's education, but in a way that engages the student and makes them excited to learn. We do not believe in a one size fits all approach.The Learning Path employs people who are excited and happy to work with children, who are leading examples within the community. For instance we have employed high school seniors from public Magnet schools that have gone on to MIT and Notre Dame, to name only two.

Making Learning A ConversationLearning becomes much more engaging when students are given the freedom to dialogue, ask questions, and give their opinion.In conversational lessons the focus shifts away from whether or not a student produces the right or wrong answers to a question, but instead to a focus on a holistic understanding of the concepts behind answers and many of the common missteps in learning new material.2. Teaching Students to Teach Others What They've LearnedIn asking students to teach back what they've learned we are not only further cementing their understanding of what they've learned, but gaining valuable insights into how students think and the way in which they've interpreted the lesson. Knowing exactly which areas a student does not understand or rather misunderstands, allows tutors to target problem areas and teach where knowledge is lacking.Meet the Business Owner",Jake A.,Yes,No,5.0 star rating,23 reviews,http://pchtutors.com/,,Mon 9:00 am - 9:30 pm<br>Tue 9:00 am - 9:30 pm<br>Wed 9:00 am - 9:30 pm<br>Thu 9:00 am - 9:30 pm<br>Fri 9:00 am - 9:30 pm<br>Sat 9:00 am - 9:30 pm<br>Sun 9:00 am - 9:30 pm<br>,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Private Tutors, Test Preparation, Electronics Repair, Mobile Phone Repair, Private Tutors, Test Preparation",,,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/heRRECRRsJvPsm8dgTexQA/ls.jpg,http://www.yelp.com/biz/pch-tutors-malibu-2?osq=Tutoring,$75 for $100 Deal at PCH Tutors,You get a voucher redeemable for $100 at PCH Tutors.,$100,25%,$25,https://www.yelp.com/checkout/deal/DaSgGEXWCqKc5bwT0YrK8w?biz_id=xNJpMKxpLh4mKVZTPPxMGQ&return_url=%2Fbiz%2Fpch-tutors-malibu-2
